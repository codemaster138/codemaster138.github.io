# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Jake. I'm a full-stack webdeveloper & designer. In this blog I want to share my knowledge of web development,
web design and occasionally about space, too.

## What you'll find here:
 - Programming tutorials 👨‍💻
 - Posts about Web Design 🎨
 - Occasionally, I like to post about space, too. 🚀

## What you won't find here:
This blog is not a complete guide to web design/development. This is just my personal blog where I occasionally share my
progress and findings in web development and design.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy my blog! [Click here for a complete list of all my blog posts](/#more)
