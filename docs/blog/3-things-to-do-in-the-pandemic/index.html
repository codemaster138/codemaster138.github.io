            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is difficult for everyone, and if you&#39;re in America, you even spent almost the entirety of 2020 in quarantine. No one really likes it, but that&#39;s how it is right now.</p>
<p>On the bright side, however, you have more time on your hands to improve as a developer. And since it almost doesn&#39;t look like that&#39;s going to end anytime soon, here are 3 things you should do in the pandemic:</p>
<h2 id="1-start-a-blog">1. Start a blog</h2>
<p>One important thing you should do is to start a blog. Even if nobody reads it, it&#39;s still a great thing to have. Every time you find out a new trick, <em>write a blog post about it</em>, when you&#39;ve built a cool new piece of software, <em>write a blog post about it</em>,….</p>
<p>However, don&#39;t put yourself on a strict schedule. Don&#39;t post every day, or every two days, or even every week. Post every time you have something to post about, but when you don&#39;t know what to write, don&#39;t force yourself. I do recommend to put a reminder in your calendar to post <strong>at least once a month</strong>. That way you won&#39;t forget your blog entirely.</p>
<h2 id="2-learn-a-new-programming-language">2. Learn a new programming language</h2>
<p>Take the time you have to learn the ins and outs of a new programming language. Choose one that you don&#39;t know at all. If you&#39;re brave, you can even try to learn a language like F# or Haskell (or if you already know functional languages, learn C#).</p>
<p>Maybe you&#39;ll fall in love with your newly-learned langauge, or maybe you&#39;ll hate it, but either way it is a good experience to have. <em>Going out side your comfort zone is one of the best ways to get better at <strong>anything</strong>, and it applies to programming to.</em></p>
<h2 id="3-learn-design">3. Learn design</h2>
<p>Even if you&#39;re a backend developer, you should learn design. It&#39;s a great thing to know about and it&#39;s also not that hard to learn. As I learn design, I notice that it&#39;s almost solely about practice. When you build your next pet project, look at how your favorite apps are designed. Then try to copy them. This technique even works if your reference app has absolute nothing in common with your project, because chances are, both of them use text, buttons and input fields.</p>
<p>Also, follow designers on your favorite social media platforms. For example, you should check out <a href="https://instagram.com/michael.filipiuk">@michael.filipiuk</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/thalion_pb">@thalion_pb</a> on instagram.</p>
